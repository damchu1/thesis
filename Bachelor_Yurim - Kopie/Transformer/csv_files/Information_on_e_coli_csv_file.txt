The maximum sequence length was set to 500.
The total amount of coding sequences meeting the prerequisites is 24615.
The largest nucleotide sequence encompasses 1500 nt.
Accordingly, the largest amino acid sequence encompasses 500 amino acids.
Keep in mind that the number of tokens, however, is the same, irrespective of whether nucleotides or amino acids are dealt
with, as one codon and one amino acid are considered as one token, respectively!
